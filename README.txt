All .csv and .arff files were created with WEKA. The wisconsin.arff and letter.arff files were imported into WEKA and the dimesionality reduction algorithms were performed to create the ica, pca, ig, and rp .arff files. 

The Python files can be run by using the following command: 
python <filename>.py

The Java files are used to compile the accuracies of the different pre-processed datafiles. They can be run in Eclipse using the weka.jar dependency
